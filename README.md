# Programming Assignment 2

## Project Overview

This project consists of two main sections focusing on image manipulation and solving linear algebra problems using basic Python and NumPy functionalities. The goal is to understand tensor manipulations for images and fundamental operations for solving linear systems, matrix inversions, and determinant calculations without relying on specialized libraries.

## Part 1: Image Manipulation

### Objective

Manipulate a loaded image tensor to perform cropping, flipping, and rotation using NumPy. This introduces concepts of matrix indexing and basic operations in computer vision.

### Tasks

1. **Cropping an Image**
   - The image is cropped symmetrically from the center to retain 60% of its original size.
   - **Goal**: Understand matrix slicing and symmetrical cropping.

2. **Horizontal Flipping**
   - The image is flipped horizontally, such that the left becomes right and vice versa.
   - **Goal**: Learn how to reverse pixel arrangements along one axis.

3. **Vertical Flipping**
   - The image is flipped vertically, swapping the top and bottom parts.
   - **Goal**: Reverse the rows of the image matrix.

4. **90Â° Counter-Clockwise Rotation**
   - The image is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
   - **Goal**: Understand how to manipulate axes and indices for rotation.

### Code Highlights

- Operations are performed without using specialized libraries (e.g., OpenCV).
- Custom loops and indexing techniques are used to achieve transformations.

## Part 2: Linear Algebra Operations

### Objective

Implement fundamental linear algebra techniques, including solving linear systems, finding matrix inverses, and calculating determinants, using NumPy. These implementations reinforce understanding of numerical methods and algorithms.

### Tasks

1. **Gaussian Elimination with Row Exchanges**
   - Implemented a function to perform Gaussian elimination with row swapping for solving systems of linear equations.
   - **Example System Solved**: A 3x3 system of equations with random coefficients.

2. **Matrix Inversion**
   - Developed a function to compute the inverse of any square matrix using row-reduction to reduced row-echelon form (RREF).
   - **Example Matrix**: A 3x3 matrix with manually entered values.

3. **Determinant Calculation**
   - Implemented a recursive function to calculate the determinant of a matrix.
   - **Example Matrix**: A 6x6 matrix with randomly generated values.
   - Compared results with NumPy's built-in determinant function (`np.linalg.det`).

### Code Highlights

- Row operations are implemented explicitly to demonstrate the underlying mathematics.
- Row-swapping ensures numerical stability during Gaussian elimination.
- Determinants are calculated recursively, with a custom sub-matrix generation function.
